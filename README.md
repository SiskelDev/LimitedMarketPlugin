# LimitedMarketPlugin
This is a Minecraft Plugin specifically Designed to Make Currency on a Server Limited.

If you have a Item and Sell it to the Server than you get a Specific amount of Money Defined in the Java Code.
The Item will be saved in a database so if you rebuy the item it will only be available the sold amount. If no one sold the item it will be not available as long as no one sold the item to the server.

**Summary:** This Plugin is a Market with Limited Stock. But all Items can be restocked if a Player sells an Item to the Server.

## Development

This Plugin is Fully in development and will only be available on my Own Server.
This Plugin will be released if I have time to make it Configurable.
